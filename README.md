# Hotel Snow City
 
Hotel management system assists us in reserving rooms, checking vacancies, editting and cancelling our bookings.It uses a menu driven system which makes it convenient for the user to acces the required command. A unique 3-digit code is generated for every user by random function and is stored as primary key in the tables. By this project we will reduce the faults in bills and minimize bill generation time. Computerized bill can be printed within fraction of seconds. Online Booking is possible by using this program. This Project is based on Python and MySQL.
